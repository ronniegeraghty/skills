| Budget | "Where does the budget come from?" | CFO |
| Risk | "What's our exposure if this fails?" | CFO, CISO |
| Comparison | "How does this compare cost-wise to alternatives?" | CFO |

### Technical Questions

Focus on architecture, scalability, and implementation.

| Pattern | Example | Personas |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Architecture | "How is this built?" | CTO |
| Integration | "How does this fit our stack?" | CTO |
| Scale | "How does this scale?" | CTO, VP Ops |
| Maintenance | "What's the maintenance burden?" | CTO, VP Ops |
| Standards | "Does this follow our patterns?" | CTO |

### Security Questions

Focus on protection, compliance, and risk.

| Pattern | Example | Personas |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Compliance | "Are we compliant with X?" | CISO |
| Data Protection | "How is data secured?" | CISO |
| Access | "Who can access this?" | CISO |
| Attack Surface | "What vulnerabilities exist?" | CISO |
| Incident Response | "What's the breach plan?" | CISO |

### Operational Questions

Focus on implementation, rollout, and ongoing operations.

| Pattern | Example | Personas |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Timeline | "When can we deliver?" | VP Ops, All |
| Resources | "What resources do we need?" | VP Ops, CFO |
| Training | "What training is required?" | VP Ops |

| Change | "How do we manage the transition?" | VP Ops |

### Product Questions

Focus on user value and market fit.

| Pattern | Example | Personas |
|---------|---------|----------|
| User Value | "What problem does this solve?" | VP Product |
| Research | "What does user research say?" | VP Product |
| Competition | "How do we compare?" | VP Product, CEO |
| Adoption | "Will users actually use this?" | VP Product |
| Success | "How do we measure success?" | VP Product, CEO |

## Question Depth Patterns

### Surface Level (What)

- "What is this?"
- "What does it do?"
- "What problem does it solve?"

### Justification Level (Why)

- "Why are we doing this?"
- "Why now?"
- "Why this approach?"

### Implementation Level (How)

- "How does this work?"
- "How will we implement this?"
- "How long will it take?"

### Risk Level (What If)

- "What if this fails?"
- "What if requirements change?"
- "What if we need to scale?"

### Comparison Level (Versus)

- "How does this compare to X?"
- "Why not use Y instead?"
- "What are the alternatives?"

## Follow-Up Patterns

After initial presentation, executives typically request:

### Documentation Requests

- Architecture diagrams
- Cost breakdowns
- Security assessments
- Compliance certifications
- User research data

### Meeting Requests

- Technical deep-dive
- Security review
- Financial review
- Stakeholder alignment

### Proof Requests

- Proof of concept
- Pilot program
- Customer references
- Benchmark data

## Preparing Responses

### The STAR Method for Executive Responses

- **S**ituation: Context and background
- **T**ask: What needed to be addressed
- **A**ction: What was/will be done
- **R**esult: Outcomes and metrics

### The Bottom Line Up Front (BLUF)

Lead with the conclusion, then provide supporting details:

1. State the recommendation or finding
2. Provide 2-3 key supporting points
3. Offer to go deeper if requested

### Quantify Everything

- Replace "faster" with "40% faster"
- Replace "cheaper" with "$50K annual savings"
- Replace "better" with specific metrics

### Anticipate the "So What?"

For every claim, be ready to explain:
- Why does this matter?
- What's the impact?
- What should we do about it?

## Red Flags by Persona

### CTO Red Flags

- "It just works" explanations
- Ignoring scale concerns
- Security afterthoughts

### CISO Red Flags

- "We'll add security later"
- Missing compliance mentions
- Unclear data handling
- No breach scenario planning

### VP Product Red Flags

- No user research cited
- Feature-focused not problem-focused
- Missing success metrics
- Competitive blindness

### VP Ops Red Flags

- Unrealistic timelines
- Missing rollout plan
